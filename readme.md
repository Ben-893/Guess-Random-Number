# This is a small application I built to practice 'while' loops .
## The program generates a random number between 1 and 10000, and records how many attempts it took using the 'while' loop for the computer to guess the correct number.

## To install
```
git clone https://github.com/Ben-893/Guess-Random-Number
```
## To Use
```

* Right click on the index file, and then Open with Google Chrome, or whatever browser you're using

* You will immediatley be presented with the text 'Let's Make Some Random Numbers :)', followed by a randomly generated number beneath, and the number of attempts it took the program to guess the correct number.

* Refresh the page as many times as you like to generate a new random number. 

*Have fun :)
